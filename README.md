# Quadcopter
Android application to control quadcopter Walkera QR W100S.

The manufacturer has long dropped support for original application WK-REMOTE that is out of date and contains a large amount of errors which can lead to a serious crash. So I decided to write my own application, which will match the modern design standards for android, to be able to configure and control sensitivity, connect gamepads.
